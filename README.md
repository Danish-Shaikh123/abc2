# About the Book
With Docker, it is possible to get a lot of apps running on the same old servers, making it very easy to package and ship programs. The ability to extend Docker using plugins and load third-party plugins is incredible, and organizations can massively benefit from it.

#Extending Docker
This is the code repository for [Extending Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/extending-docker?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786463142), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
abcd
