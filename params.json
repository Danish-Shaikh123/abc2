It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.\r\n## About the Book\r\nWith Docker, it is possible to get a lot of apps running on the same old servers, making it very easy to package and ship programs. The ability to extend Docker using plugins and load third-party plugins is incredible, and organizations can massively benefit from it.\r\n\r\n##Instructions and Navigations\r\nAll of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code will look like the following:\r\n```\r\nabcd\r\nddd\r\nfff\r\n```\r\n\r\nabcd\r\n\r\n##Related Products\r\n* [Mastering Docker](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-docker?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785287039)\r\n\r\n* [Docker: Creating Structured Containers](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/docker-creating-structured-containers?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786465931)\r\n\r\n* [Docker High Performance](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/docker-high-performance?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785886805)\r\n###Suggestions and Feedback\r\n[Click here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5qwunkGf6PUvzPirPDtuy1Du5Rlzew23UBp2S-P3wB-GcwQ/viewform) if you have any feedback or suggestions.\r\n",
